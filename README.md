## Introduction

We propose a combination of the Gram matrix-based style transfer and Patch matching-based style transfer for shape stylization. This is achieved by adding "Distance transform module" and "Shape matching module" to the regular neural style transfer.

## Running the code

### Style transfer
```
python main.py -content_path <path_to_content_image> -style_path <patch_to_style_image>
```
### Other default parser arguments:
```
alpha = 1e-1        # More emphasize on content loss. Override with -alpha
beta  = 1e-1        # More emphasize on style loss. Override with -beta
gamma = 1e-6        # More emphasize on patch matching loss. Override with -gamma
delta = 1e2         # More powerful constrain. Override with -delta
epoch = 5000        # Set the number of epochs to run. Override with -epoch
image size = 256    # Determine image size. Override with -image_size
patch size = 5      # Size of the patch for patch matching module. Override with -patch_size
```
